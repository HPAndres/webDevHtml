        <h2>A small introduction to Web Developing</h2>

        <p>Web development refers to the process of creating and maintaining websites or web applications. It involves a combination of frontend and backend development, as well as other aspects such as database management, server configuration, and security considerations. Web development can range from simple static websites to complex dynamic web applications.</p>

            <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
            <p>
                This is where the user interacts with the website. It can sometimes be referred as the 'client side' of the website. Frontend development refers to the process of creating the user interface and user experience of a website or web application. It involves the design and implementation of the visual elements that users interact with directly. Frontend developers, also known as client-side developers, focus on the presentation layer of a website, ensuring that it is visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly.

            <h3>Backend Development</h3>
            <p>
                Users can not see this side of the website, it the server side. This portion of the software does not come in contact with the user. Backend development refers to the server-side of web development, where the logic, database interactions, and server-side scripting take place. It is responsible for handling requests from the frontend, processing data, and managing the business logic of a web application.
